		<h3>About:</h3>
		<p>This is the HTML description file of Object Oriented Programming Module 2 in Java. For code check the github repo.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Composition is the idea that different pieces will add up to create one giant chunk.</li>
			<li>In JAVA programming we create different small objects and then we create one object that contains all of these classes.</li>
			<li>Composition is fundamentally different from inheretence as in you can only extend to one class there but in composition you can include as many classes as you wish.</li>
			<li>A general rule of thumb is try to use  composition if it doesn't work only then move to inheritence.</li>
			<li>Encapsulation is the process to prevent outside classes to access the code. It is very important to use it otherwise our code might break down.</li>
			<li>The issue is if you change anything in the class it affects the main. It won't be an issue for a small code but for a big library it really becomes painful.</li>
			<li>Polymorphism allows actions to act differently on the object that the action is performed on.</li>
