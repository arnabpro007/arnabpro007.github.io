        <h2>Options, Futures, and other Derivatives </h2>

        <h4>Chapter-1: Introduction</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In the last 30 years , derivatives have become increasingly important in finance. futures and options are actively traded on many exchanges throughout the world.</li>
            <li>Derivatives can be used for hedging or speculation or arbitrage.</li>
            <li><strong>Derivatives: </strong> A derivate can be defined as financial instrument whose value depends on ( or derived from) the values of other, more basic variables. <br> Very Often the variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets.</li>
            <li>A <strong>derivates exchange </strong> is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. </li>
            <li>Traditionally derivatives exchanges have used what is known as the <em>open outcry system.</em> This involves traders physically meetin on the floor of the exchange, shouting and using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry out. Exchanges are increasingly replacing the open outcry system by <em>electronic trading</em>. This involves traders entering their desired trades at a keyboard and a computer being used to match buyers and sellers.</li>
            <li>Electronic trading has led to a growth in algorithmic trading (also known as black-box trading, automated trading, high frequency trading, or robo trading). This involves the use of computer programs to initiate trades often without human intervention.</li>
            <li>Not all trading of derivatives is done on exchanges. The over-the-counter market is an important alternative to exchanges and, measured in terms of the total volume of trading, has become much larger than the exchange-traded market.</li>
            <li>It is a telephone and computer-linked network of dealers. Trades are done over the phone and are usually between two financial institutions or between a financial institution and one of its clients.Financial institutions often act as market makers for the more commonly traded instruments. This means that they are always prepared to quote both a bid price (a price at which they are prepared to buy) and an offer price (a price at which they are prepared to sell).</li>
            <li>A disadvantage is that there is usually some credit risk in an over-the-counter trade.(i.e., there is a small risk that the contract will not be honored)</li>
            <li>Using the measures of The Bank for international Settlements, we see that by Dec 2009, the over-the-counter market had grown to 614.7 trillion dollars and the exchange-traded market had grown to 73.1 trillion.</li>
            <li>In interpreting these numbers, we should bear in mind that the principal underlying an over-the-counter transaction is not the same as its value. An example is an agreement to buy 100 million US dollars with British pounds at a predetermined exchange rate in 1 year. The total principal amount underlying this transaction is 100 mil. However the value of the contract might only be 1 million.</li>
            <h5>Forward Contracts: </h5> 
            <ul>
            <li>A relatively simple derivatives is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with the <em>spot contract</em> ,which is an agreement to buy or sell asset today. </li> 
            <li>A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market.</li>
            <li> One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a <em>long position</em> and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a <em>short position</em> and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.   </li>
            <li>Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that, on May 24,2010, the treasurer of a US corporation knows that the corporation will pay 1 million in 6 months, and wants to hedge against exchange rate moves. The treasurer then can agree to buy 1 million 6 months forward at a certain exchange rate. The corporation thus has a long forward contract on GBP. The bank then has the short forward contract. Both sides have made a binding commitment.</li>
            <li>In general, the payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is <strong>S <sub>T</sub> - K</strong> </li>
            <li>K os the delivery price and S is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the contract. Similarly the payoff from a short position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is <strong>K - S <sub>T</sub></strong></li>
            
            


        </ul>

        <h5>Futures Contracts: </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. Unlike foward contracts, futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange.</li>
            <li>To make the trading possible, the exchanges specifies certain standardized features of the contract.</li>
            <li>As the two parties to the contract do not necessarily know each other, the exchange also provides a mechanism that gives the two parties a guarantee that the contract will be honored.</li>


        </ul>

        <h5>Options: </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the counter market.</li>
            <li>There are two types of option. A <strong>call option </strong> gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.</li>
            <li>A <strong>put option</strong> gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.</li>
            <li>The price in the contract is known as the <em>excercise price or strike price</em></li>
            <li>The Date in the contract is known as expiration date or maturity date.</li>
            <li>American Options can be excercised at any time up to the expiration date.</li>
            <li>European Options can be excercised only on the expiration date itself.</li>
            <li>Most of the options that are traded are American.</li>
            <li>One contract = buy/sell 100 shares</li>
            <li>European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counter part</li>
            <li>It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something. The holder doesn't have to excercise this right. This is what distinguishes options from forwards and futures. Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to aquiring an option</li>
            <li>There are some particular emperical trends: The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases.</li>
            <li>Both types of option becomes more valuable as their time of maturity increases.</li>
            <li>There are 4 types of participants in options markets: <ol>
                <li>Buyers of calls</li>
                <li>Sellers of calls</li>
                <li>Buyers of puts</li>
                <li>Sellers of puts</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li>Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.</li>


        </ul>

        <h5>Types of Traders:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successfull. The main reason is that they have attracted many different types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity.</li>
            <li>Three broad categories of traders can be identified: hedgers, speculators , and arbitrageurs</li>
            <li><strong>Hedgers</strong> use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in the market.</li>
            <li><strong>Speculators</strong> use them to bet on the future direction of a market variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitrageurs</strong> take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in profit.</li>


        </ul>
        <li>One final thing that should be noted is , The purpose of hedging is to reduce risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging.</li>

        </ul>

        <h5>Chapter-1 Doubts & Q&A:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>We defined derivatives as something dependent on some basic variables. <br> What are basic variables? <br> Can a derivative be a basic variable to some other derivative? <br>Are these relations/dependency deterministic or probabilistic.</li>
            <li>Consider a tock that pays no dividend and is worth $60. You can borrow or lend money for 1 year at 5%. What should be the 1-year forward price of the stock be ? <br>
            <strong>Ans. </strong> $60 grossed up at 5% for 1 year or $63. Now what if the forward price is not $63. Then there are two different scenarios. First case is when the forward price 
            is more than what it should be say it is $67. Then you can borrow $60, buy one share of the stock , and sell it forward for $67. After paying off the loan, you would net a profit of $4 in 1 year. 
            Now for the other case, let's say the forward price is %58. An investor owing the stock as part of a portfolio would sell the stock for $60 and enter into a forward contract to buy it back for $58 in 1 year. The proceeds of investment would be invested at 5% to earn $3. The investor would end up $5 better off than if the stock were kept in the 
            portfolio for the year.
            </li>
        </ul>



        <h4>Mechanics of Futures Market</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>As we already know futures and forward contracts are agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future time for a certain orice. Futures contracts are traded on organized exchange, and the contract terms are standardized by that exchange. By contrast, forward contracts are private agreements between two financial instituitions or btween a financial institution and one of its client.</li>
            <li><em>Example: </em> Say on March 5 a trader in New York might call a broker with insturctions to buy 5000 bushels of corn for delivery in July of the same year. The broler would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy (take a long position) one July corn contract. At about the same time, another trader in kansas might instruct a broker to sell 5000 bushels of corn for July delivery. This broker would then issue instructions to sell (take short position in )one corn contract. A price would be determined and deal would be done. Under the traditional open outcry system, floor traders representing each party would physically meet to determine the price. With electronic trading, a computer would match the traders. </li>
            <li>The price agreed to is the current future price for July corn. This price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more traders wish to sell rather than buy July corn, the price will go down.</li>
            <h5>Closing Out Positions: </h5>
            <p>The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. The reason is that most traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the contract.
                Closing out a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original one. For example, the New York investor who bought a July corn futures contract on March 5 can close out the position by selling one July corn futures contract on say April 20.
                The Kansas investor who sold a July contract on March 5 can close out the position by buying one July contract on, say, May 25. In each case, the investor's total gain or loss is determined by the change in the futures price between March 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.
                
            </p>

            <h5>Specification of a Futures Contract:</h5>
            <p>When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular , it must specify the asset, the contract size(exactly
                how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract), where delivery will be made, and when delivery will be made.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Asset: </strong> When the asset is a comodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is available in the marketplace., When the asset is 
                specified, it is therefore important that the exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable.</li>
                <li>The IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) has specified the different grades of different assets.</li>
                <li>The financial assets in futures contracts are generaly well defined and unambiguous.</li>

                <li><strong>The Contract Size:</strong> The contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract. This is an important decision for the exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Delivery Arrangements: </strong> The place where delivery will be made must be specified by the exchange. This is particularly important for commodities that involve significant transportation costs. </li>
                <li><strong>Delivery Months:</strong> A futures contract is refered to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures contracts, the delivery period is the whole month.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Quotes: </strong> The exchange defines how price will be quoted For example , in the US, crude oild futures prices are quoted in dollars and cents.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Limits and Position Limits: </strong>For most contracts, daily price movement limits are specified by the exchange. If in a day the price moves down from the previous day's close by an amount equal to the daily price limit, the contract is said to be <em>limit down</em>. Similarly if it moves up by equivalent amount it is known as limit up.
                A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down. However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the limits. Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold. The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from excercising undue influence on the market.</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Convergence of Futures Price to Spot Price:</h5>

            <p>As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the future price equals or is very close to the spot price.
                (Think Deeply , you'll see why). To illustrate, let's say future price >> spot price, then the investor will sell the contract (assuming there are always people to buy) then buy the asset at spot price and make a delivery.
            </p>

            <h5>The Operation of Margins: </h5>
            <p>If two investors get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the future for a certain price, there are obvious risks.
                One of the investors may regret the deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the investor may not have the financial resources to honor the agreement.
                One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily Settlement: </strong>
                <p>
                    We consider an investor who contacts his/her broker to buy two december gold future contracts. The broker will require the investor to 
                    deposit funds in a <em>margin account</em>. The amount that must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into is known as the 
                    <em> initial margin</em>. At the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the investor's gain or loss. This practice is 
                    refered to as <em>daily settlement or marking to market</em>.  Note that daily settlement is not merely an arrangement between broker and client.
                    When there is a decrease in the future price then the broker of the long position has to pay the settlement to the exchange and the exchange passes 
                    it to the broker of the short position and vice versa.
                </p>

                
                </li>
                <li>The investor is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account in excess of the initial margin. To ensure that
                    the balance in the margin account never becomes negative a <em>maintenance margin</em>, which is somewhat lower than the initial
                     margin, is set. If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the investor receives a margin call and is expected
                     to top the margin account to the initial margin level by end of the next day. The extra funds deposited are known as a variation margin. If the 
                     investor does not provide the variation margin, the broker closes out the position.
                </li>

                <li>Most brokers pay the investors interest on the balance in a margin account. The balance in the account does not, therefore, represent a true cost. 
                    Whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, a future contract is, as we have seen, settled daily. At the end of each day, the investor's
                     gain or loss is added to the margin account , bringing the value of the contract back to 0, A futures contract is in effect closed out and re-written everyday.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Minimum levels for initial and maintenance margins are set by the exchange. Individual brokers may require greater margins from their clients than those specified 
                    by the exchange. However, they cannot require lower margins than those specified by the exchange. Margin levels are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying 
                    asset. The higher the variability, the higher the maintenance level. The maintenance margin is usually about 75% of the initial margin.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>The Clearing House and Clearing Margins: </strong> A clearing house acts as an intermediary in futures transactions. It guarantees the performance of the parties to each transaction.
                    The clearing house has a number of members, who must post funds with the clearing house. The main task of the clearing house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a day,
                    so that it can calculate the net position of each of its members. Most clearing house/exchanges currently use net margining = #long position - #short position
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Credit Risk: </strong> The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay traders when they make a profit. Overall the system has been very successful. Traders 
                    entering into contracts at major exchanges have always had their contracts honored.
                </li>






            </ul>


            <h5>OTC Markets: </h5>
            <p>Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of the over-the-counter markets. There is always a chance that the party on the other side of an OTC trade 
                will default. It is interesting that , in an attempt to reduce credit risk, the OTC market has adopted some of the procedures used by the exchanges.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collateralization: </strong>Collateralization has been used in OTC markets for some time and is similar to the practice of posting margin in futures markets.
                Consider two companies, A and B, that have entered into an OTC derivatives transaction such as a forward. If, from one day to next, the value of company A increases by X then company B has to pay X to company A 
                The contract is not settled daily, as in the case of futures.
            
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Use of Clearing House: </strong> Since the 2007-2009 crisis, government in the US and elsewhere have passed legislation requiring clearing houses to be used for some OTC transactions. The way in which clearing houses
                 work in the OTC market is as follows. An OTC transaction is negotiated between two parties, A and B, in the usual way. It is then presented to the clearing house. Assuming the clearing house accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty
                 to both A and B. The clearing house takes on the credit risk of both A and B. It manages the risk by requiring an inital margin and daily variation margins from them. A number of arguments have been cited for the use of clearing houses in OTC markets.
                 Collateral will automatically have to be posted; credit risk in the financial syste, will be reduced; and the trades taking place in the OTC market will become more transparent. A major concern of the government since the credit crisis of 2007 is systemic risk.
                 This is the risk that a failure by a large financial institution will lead to failures by other large financial institutions and a collapse of the financial system.
            </li>








            </ul>
            <h5>Market Quotes: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Futures quotes are available from exchanges and from several online sources. futures.tradingcharts.com/marketquotes </li>
                <li><strong>Price: </strong> The first three number in each row show the opening price, the highest price price achieved in trading during the day, and the lowest price achieved in trading during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Settlement Price: </strong> The fourth number is the settlement price. This is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and the margin requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract is traded immediately before the end of a day's trading session.</li>
                <li><strong>Trading Volume and Open Interest: </strong> The trading volume is the number of contracts traded. The open interest is the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equivalently the number of short positions. Trading volume can be greater than open interest it indicates that many traders who entered the market closed out position before end of the day.</li>
                <li><strong> Patterns of Futures Prices: </strong>  Futures prices can show a number of different patterns. The future price of gold generally increases with the maturity of the contract. Markets where the future price is an increasing function of the time to maturity are known as <em>normal markets</em>. Markets where the futures price decreases with the maturity of the futures contract are known as <em>inverted markets</em> </li>
                <li><strong>Delivery: </strong>There are three critical day for a contract. The <em>first notice day</em> is the first day on which a notice of intention to make delivery can be submitted to the exchange. The <em>last notice day</em> is the last such day. The <em>last trading day</em> is generally a few days before the last notice day. To avoid the risk of having to take delivery, an investor with a long position should close out his or her contracts prior to the first notice day.</li>



            </ul>

            <h5>Types of Traders and Types of Orders: </h5>
            <p>
                There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants (FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.
                Individuals taking positions can be classified into speculators, hedgers and arbitrageurs. Speculators can be classified as scalpers (holding positions only for a few minutes), day traders (holding position for a few hours) and Position traders (holding position for long term).

            <ul>
                <li>The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order.It is a request that a trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market.</li>
                <li>A <em>limit order</em> specifies a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price or at one more favorable to the investor. There is, of course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all,because the limit price may never be reached.</li>
                <li>A <em>stop order</em> also specifies a particular price. The order is executed at the best available price once a bid or offer is made at that particular price or a less-favorable price. The purpose of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.</li>
                <li>A <em>stop-limit order</em> is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. the order becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or offer is made at a price equal to or less favorable than the stop price.</li>
                <li> A <em>market-if-touched (MIT) order</em> is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. In effect, an MIT becomes a market order once the specified price has been hit. MIT order is designed to ensure that profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur. </li>
                <li>A <em>discretionary order or market-not-held order </em> is traded as a market order except that execution may be delayed at the broker's discretion in an attempt to get a better price.</li>
                <li>Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order and expires at the end of the trading day. A <em>time-of-day order</em> specifies a particular period of time during the day when the order can be executed. An <em>open-order or a good-till-canceled order</em> is in effect until executed. A <em>fill-or-kill order</em> must be executed immediately on reciept or not at all.</li>

            <h4>Hedging Strategies Using Futures: </h4>
            <p>Many of the participants of the futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. The risk might relate to fluctuations in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the 
                level of the stock market , or some other vairable. A <em>perfect hedge</em> is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the ways 
                in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfect as possible. Here we will assume that no attempt is made to adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply take a futures position at the 
                begining of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end of the life of the hedge.
            </p>

            <h5>Basic Priniciples: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is usually to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible.</li>
                <li>A <strong>short hedge </strong> is a hedge that involves a short position in futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the future. A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned right now but will be 
                owned at some time in the future. </li>
                <li>Hedges that involve taking a long position in a futures contract are known as <strong>long hedges</strong>. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h5>arguments for and against hedging: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Most companies are in the business of manufacturing, or retailing or wholesaling or providing a service. They have no particular skills or expertise in predicting variables such as interest rates, and commodity prices. It makes sense for them to hedge the risks
                    associated with these variables as they become aware of them. In practice, many risks are left unhedged.
                </li>
                <li>One argument sometimes put forward is that the shreholders can,if they wish do the hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. They are less immune to many risks but they have higher additional costs associated with their portfolio.</li>
                <li>If hedging is not the norm in a certain industry, it may not make sense for one particular company to choose to be different from all others. Competetive pressures within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by the industry fluctuate to reflect raw material consts , interest rates, exchange rates, and so on. However , a company that does hedge can expect its profit margins to fluctuate.</li>
                <li>All the implications of price changes on a company's profitability should be taken into account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.</li>
                <li>It is important to realize that a hedge using futures contracts can result in a decrease or increase in a company's profits relative to the position it would be in with no hedging.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h5>Basis Risk: </h5>
            <p>Some of the most well known examples from the book are almost too good to be true. The hedger was able to identify the precise date in the future when an asset would be bought or sold. The hedger was then able to use futures contracts to remove almost all the risk arising from the price of the asset on that day.
                In practice , hedging is often not quite as straightforward as this. Some of the reasons are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract.</li>
                    <li>The hedger may be uncertain as to the exact date when the asset will be bought or sold.</li>
                    <li>The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery.</li>

                    
                </ul>
                These problems gives rise to what is termed as <em>basis risk.</em>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The basis in a hedging situation is as follows: Basis = Spot price of the asset to be hedged - Futures price of contract used</li>
                <li>If the asset to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract are the same, the basis should be zero at the expiration of the futures contract.</li>
                <li>Prior to the expiration, the basis may be positive or negative. As time passes, the spot price and the futures price for a particular month do not necessarily change by the same amount.
                    As a result, the basis changes. An increase in basis is known as a <em>strengthening of the basis</em>, and a decrease in the basis is referred to as a <em>weakening of the basis.</em>
                </li>
                <li>Let's use the following notation: <br>
                    S<sub>1</sub> : Spot price at time t<sub>1</sub> <br>
                    S<sub>2</sub> : Spot price at time t<sub>2</sub> <br>
                    F<sub>1</sub> : Futures price at time t<sub>1</sub> <br>
                    F<sub>2</sub> : Futures price at time t<sub>2</sub> <br>
                    b<sub>1</sub> : Basis at time t<sub>1</sub> <br>
                    b<sub>2</sub> : Basis at time t<sub>2</sub> <br>
                </li>
                <li>By our model b<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>  &  b<sub>2</sub> = S<sub>2</sub> - F<sub>2</sub></li>
                <li>Consider the situation of a hedger who that the asset will be sold at time t<sub>2</sub> and takes a short futures position at time t<sub>1</sub>. The effective price that is obtained for the asset with hedging is therefore:  S <sub>2</sub> + F <sub>1</sub> - F <sub>2</sub> = F <sub>1</sub> + b <sub>2</sub></li>
                <li>If a company is going to buy even then the effective price remains same as above.</li>
                <li><strong>Choice of Contract: </strong> One key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to be used for hedging. The choice has two components <br>
                1. The choice of the asset underlying the futures contract. <br>
                2. The choice of the delivery month. <br>
                </li>
                <li>If the asset being hedged exactly matches an asset underlying a futures contract, the first choice is generally fairly easy. In other circumstances, it is necessary to carry out a careful analysis to determine which of the available futures contract has futures prices that are most closely correlated with the price of the asset being hedged.</li>
                <li>In general, basis risk increases as the time difference between the hedge expiration and the delivery month increases. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than , the expiration of the hedge.</li>

            
            
            
            
            
            
            </ul>

            <h5>Cross Hedging: </h5>
            <p>Cross hedging occurs when the two assets are different. Consider ,for example , an airline is concerned about the futures price of jet fuel. Because jet fuel futures are not actively traded, it might choose to use heating oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the size of the exposure.</li>
                <li> When the asset underlying the futures contract is the same as the asset being hedged , it is natural to use a hedge ratio of 1.0</li>
                <li>When cross hedging is used, setting the hedge ratio equal to 1.0 is not always optimal. The hedger should choose a value for the hedge ratio that minimizes the variance of the value of the hedged position.</li>
                <li>Minimum Variance Hedge ration ---> In the notebook (using regression)</li>
                <li>Optimal Number of Contracts ---> In the notebook</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Stock Index Futures: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>A <em>stock index </em> tracks changes in the value of a hypothetical portfolio of stocks</li>
                <li>The weight of a stock in the portfolio at a particular time equals the proportion of the hypothetical portfolio invested in the stock at that time.</li>
                <li>The percentage increase in the stock index over a small interval of time is set equal to the percentage increase in the value of the hypothetical portfolio. Dividends are usually not included in the calculation so that the index tracks the capital gain/loss from investing in the portfolio.</li>
                <li>If the hypothetical portfolio of stocks remains fixed, the weights assigned to individual stocks in the portfolio do not remain fixed. When the price of one particular stock rises more sharply than others, more weights is automatically given to that stock.</li>
                <li>Sometimes indices are constructed from a hypothetical portfolio consisting of one of each of a number of stocks. The weights assigned to the stocks are then proportional to the market price, with adjustment being made when there are stock splits.Other indices are constructed so that weights are proportional to market capitalization (stock price * number of shares outstanding)</li>
                <li><em>Dow Jones Industrial Average</em> is based on a portfolio consisting of 30 blue-chip stocks in the United States , The <em>Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index</em> is based on a portfolio of 500 different stocks, <em>The Nasdaq-100 </em> is based on 100 stocks using the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations Service, The <em>Russell 1000 Index </em> is an index is an index of the price of the 1000 largest capitalization stocks in the United States.</li>

                    <h6>Hedging an Equity Portfolio:</h6>
                    <p>
                        Stock index futures can be used to hedge a well-diversified equity portfolio. Define <br>
                        V <sub>A</sub> : Current value of the portfolio. <br>
                        V <sub>F</sub> : Current value of one futures contract (the futures price times the contract size). <br>
                        If the portfolio mirrors the index the optimal hedge ratio h <sup>*</sup> = 1.0 and the number of futures contracts that should be shorted is <br>
                        N <sup>*</sup> = V <sub>A</sub>/V <sub>F</sub> <br>
                        When the portfolio doesnot exactly mirror the index, we can use the <strong>capital asset pricing model</strong>. The formula for the number of contracts is adjusted by multiplying with beta.

                    <h6>Reasons for Hedging an Equity Portfolio: </h6>
                    <p>
                        It is natural to ask why the hedger should go to the trouble of using futures contracts. To earn the risk free interest rate, the hedger can simply sell the portfolio and invest the proceeds
                         in risk free instruments such as Treasury bills. One answer to that question is that hedging can be justified if the hedger feels that the stocks in the portfolio have been chosen well. In these circumstances, the hedger might be very uncertain about the performance of the market as a whole, but confident that the stocks in the portfolio will outperform
                          the market. A hedge using index futures removes the risk arising from market moves and leaves the hedger exposed only to the performance of the portfolio relative to the market.

            </ul>
            <h4>Interest Rates:</h4>
            <p>Interest rates are a factor in the valuation of virtually all derivatives. Here we will discuss some fundamental issues concerned with the way interest rates are measured and analyzed. </p>
            <h5>Types of Rates:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>An interest rate in a particular situation defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many different types of interest rates are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing rates and so on.</li>
                <li>The interest rate applicable in a situation depends on the credit risk. This is the risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest rates and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower.</li>
                <li><strong>Treasury Rates: </strong>Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency. It is usually assued that there is no chance that a government will default on an obligation denominated in its own currency. Treasury rates are therefore totally risk free rates. </li>
                <li><strong>LIBOR: </strong>LIBOR is short for <em>London Interbank Offered Rate</em>. It is a reference interest rate, produced once a day by the British Banker's Association, and is designed to reflect the rate of interest at which banks are prepared to make large wholesale depositis with other bank. 1 month LIBOR is the rate at which 1 month deposits are offered. 3-month LIBOR is the rate at which 3 month deposits are offered and so on </li>
                <li>A deposit with a bank can be regarded as a loan to that bank. A bank must therefore satisfy certain creditworthiness criteria in order to be able to receive deposits from another bank at LIBOR. Typically it must have a AA credit rating.</li>
                <li>A rate closesly related to LIBOR is <strong>LIBID</strong>. This is the <em>London Interbank Bid Rate</em> and is the rate at which banks will accept deposits from other banks. At any specified time, there is a small spread between LIBID and LIBOR rates (with LIBOR higher than LIBID)</li>
                <li>The rates themselves are determined by active trading between banks and adjust so that the supply of funds in the interbank market equals the demand for funds in that market.</li>
                <li><strong>Repo Rate: </strong> Sometimes trading activities are funded with a repurchase agreement, repo. This is a contract where an investment dealer who owns securities agrees to sell them to another company now and buy them back later at a slightly higher price. The other company is providing a loan to the investment dealer. The difference between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which they are repurchased is the interest it earns. The interest rate is referred to as the repo rate. If structured carefully, the loan involves very little credit risk.</li>
                <li>The most common type of repo is an overnight repo, in which the agreement is renegotiated every day. However, longer term arrangements, known as term repos are sometimes used.</li>
                <li><strong>The Risk-free Rate: </strong> The risk free rate is used extensively in the evaluation of derivatives. It might be thought that derivatives traders would use the interest rates implies by Treasury bills and bonds as risk free rates. In fact, they do not do this. Derivatives dealers argue that the interest rates implied by Treasury bills and Treasury bonds are artificially low.</li>
                <li>Traditionally derivatives dealers have assumed that LIBOR rates are risk-free and for ease of exposition, this what we will do as well. But LIBOR rates are not totally risk free. Following the credit crisis that started in 2007, many dealers switched to using overnight indexed swap rates as risk free rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Measuring Interest Rates: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Suppose amount A is invested for n years at an interest rate of R per annum. If the rate compounded once per annum, the terminal value of the investment is A(1+R) <sup>n</sup></li>
                <li>If the rate is compounded m times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is = A(1 + R/m) <sup>mn</sup></li>                                  
                <li><strong>Continuous Compounding: </strong> The limit as the compounding frequency , m , tends to infinity is known as continuous compounding. With continuous compounding, it can be shown that an amount A invested for n years at rate R grows to Ae<sup>Rn</sup></li>
                <li>Suppose that R<sub>e</sub> is a rate of interest with continuous compounding and R<sub>m</sub> is the equivalent rate with compounding m times per annum. Then a handy conversion formula is:  R<sub>m</sub> = m(e <sup>R<sub>c</sub>/m</sup> - 1)</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Rates: </strong>The n-year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for n years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of n years. There are no intermediate payments</li>
                



            </ul>
            
            <h5>Bond Pricing: </h5>
            <p>Most bonds pay coupons to the holders periodically. The bond's principal is paid at the end of its life. The theoretical price of a bond can be calculated as the present value of all the cash flows that will be recieved by the owner of the bond.
                Sometimes bond traders use the same discount rate for all the cash flows underlying a bond, but a more accurate approach is to use a different zero rate for each cash flow. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bond Yield: </strong>A bond's yield is the single discount rate that, when applied to all cash flows, gives a bond price equal to its market price.</li>
                <li><strong>Par Yield: </strong>The par yield for a certain bond maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to equal its par value (the par value is the same as the principal value). </li>

            </ul>
